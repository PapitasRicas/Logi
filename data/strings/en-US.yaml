DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_DE_POPPER: High-Pass Filter lets the high frequency information pass through the filter at a target frequency and rolls off all audio below the target frequency. This can be helpful to remove low frequency noise like car engines or heavy equipment and even fans in the room.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_DE_ESSER: De-esser listens to the high frequencies for hissing or sibilant sounds that are generally unpleasant. The tool listens at the target frequency (8KHz by default) and compresses that frequency when the threshold is reached by the amount set by the ratio control.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_NOISE_REDUCTION: Noise reduction removes unwanted noise from an audio signal. It is best at removing consistently produced noises like fans, road noise, rain and other non-anomalous and consistent unwanted sounds.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_COMPRESSOR: Compressor reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal by attenuating the output in relation to the threshold and ratio controls. This essentially makes your voice signal more consistent in volume and therefore easier to hear whether you are screaming or whispering.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_EXPANDER: Expander is a noise gate with a variable range. This can be very useful to remove unwanted background noise like dog barking, children playing, television, etc when not speaking into the mic. If you set the threshold slightly below the level of your voice, the gate will open only when you're speaking and cut out any other noise when you’re not.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_LIMITER: Limiter is a tool that attenuates the signal at a target threshold and can bring the overall level up to a consistent volume using gain boost. This ensures that the signal will not be louder than the target value but will still be consistently loud.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_VOICE_EQUALIZER: VOICE EQ
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_GATE: A noise gate mutes the mic when the signal level is below the target threshold. This can help remove unwanted ambient noise that is lower than the volume of the desired signal.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_HIGH_PASS_FILTER: High-Pass allows the high frequency information to pass through the filter at the target frequency and rolls off all audio below the target. This can help eliminate low frequency rumble like engines, equipment, fans or desk noise.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_DE_POPPER_2: De-Popper listens to the low frequencies for plosives and pops that are unpleasant or will overload the mic signal. The filter compresses the signal at the target frequency when the signal passes the selected threshold.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_REVERB: Reverb creates the sense of the signal being produced in a different space with different size and echo feedback.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_TIME_DELAY: Delay changes the timing and repeats of the signal.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_RING_MODULATOR: Ring Mod alters the frequency of the signal to create interesting and sometimes extreme effects.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_PRIMARY_VOICE: Primary voice is the first of two distinct voices that can be shifted using one of the preset styles combined to make polyphonic effects.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_SECONDARY_VOICE: Secondary voice is the second of two distinct voices that can be shifted using one of the preset styles and combined to make polyphonic effects.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_FLANGER_PHASER: Flanger/Phaser changes the phase alignment of the signal which can create the sensation of movement and other interesting effects.
DEVICE_MICROPHONE_SETTINGS_ADVANCED_SETTING_TOOLTIP_CHORUS: Chorus varies the timing and pitch of the signal to create interesting effects. Both Primary and Secondary Voices must be active to use the chorus effect.
